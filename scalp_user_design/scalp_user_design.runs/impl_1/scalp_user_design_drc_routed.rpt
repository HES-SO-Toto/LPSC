RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 PLxB.ImGenxB.loop_top[10].mandel/my_Bram_inst/ram_name_reg_0_1 has an input control pin PLxB.ImGenxB.loop_top[10].mandel/my_Bram_inst/ram_name_reg_0_1/ENARDEN (net: PLxB.ImGenxB.loop_top[10].mandel/my_Bram_inst/wea[0]) which is driven by a register (PLxB.ImGenxB.loop_top[10].mandel/mandelbrot_seq_inst/FSM_sequential_state_pres_s_reg[1]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
